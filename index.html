    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would present the security issue in different ways depending on what kind of website my client wants (is it a blog or a bank?). But no matter what kind of website it is, I would no matter what recommend three things: Use HTTPS (which is the more secure version of HTTP and will encrypt the data transfer between a user and a website), always use a credible Host with good security (check if they have support and what kind of security measures they are taking), and never use unprotected networks when working on the website. This is like the foundation of your journey towards good web security.
      Further, I would recommend them to use a front-end developer to build their website, not only use free themes and block-editors. An important part of our expertise is to know about the different threats a website and our information can face online. Even if a block-editor can be hosted through a trusted tool and with tested code, you are still going to be in the backseat regarding important security measures and questions. When you are working with a front-end dev. you will get first-hand advice and expertise. If you are using a front-end dev. to build your website, you should always follow their advice and their protocols for testing and deploying new code and changes.
